### 📝 Description

Write a short summary of what you added. Why is it important? Any member of C4C should be able to read this and understand your contribution -- not just your team members.

Now, describe the code changes you made to support this. Be specific! This includes describing any design decisions you had to make, and referencing specific classes, files, components, etc., where you made particular changes.

**If you added or modified a page on the frontend, please include its path - e.g., `/pantry-application`. If you added or modified a backend endpoint, please include the HTTP method and the route - e.g., `POST /api/pantries`.** This will make it easier for other people to find and test out your new addition!

### ✔️ Verification

What steps did you take to verify your changes work? These should be clear enough for someone to be able to clone the branch and follow the steps themselves.

Describe any new unit tests you added.

Provide screenshots of any new components, styling changes, or pages.
